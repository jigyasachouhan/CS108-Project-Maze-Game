# Maze Game: The Labyrinth


The Labyrinth is a classic Maze Game similar to the ones we have all played in newspapers and magazines. The objective of the game is to navigate through the maze from the start point to the end point. The maze is a complex network of paths and walls, and the player must find the correct path to reach the end point while avoiding obstacles and traps. The game requires strategic thinking, problem-solving skills, and quick reflexes.
The Labyrinth is an enhanced version of the above-described maze game. We are supposed to navigate through a maze using keyboard arrow keys to the end point. The twist is, at any given point, we can only view a fraction of the maze around the player, making it all more intriguing!
